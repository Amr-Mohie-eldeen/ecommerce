# Common Library

Shared components for services:
- Config loading (env-based), logging, tracing helpers
- Kafka adapters (producer/consumer), DB utilities, Redis cache
- Error types and domain interfaces (ports)

Layout suggestion (to be implemented as needed):
- `config/`, `logging/`, `telemetry/`, `events/`, `db/`, `cache/`
